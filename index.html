            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and
            a year’s appointment at Stanford,
            stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            <br> <br>

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
            the Big Bang.
            Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the
            presumed course of
            cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force,
            causing the universe
            to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

            <br> <br>

            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes
            like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous
            ballooning would iron out
            all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
            detection, like spit in the ocean.
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

            <br> <br>

            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
            known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            <br> <br>

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac
            of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
            gravitational waves — the signature of a universe
            being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
            old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence
            of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
            whether it could ever be proved.

            <br> <br>

            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
            dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
            space and energy to science and speculation.

            <br> <br>

            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
            hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
            architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
            other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

            <br> <br>

            <b> ‘As Big as It Gets’ </b>

            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
            reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
            would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

            <br> <br>

            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
            “This is huge, as big as it gets.”


            <br> <br>

            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
            waves.”

            <br> <br>

            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
            space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
            sun.

            <br> <br>

            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
            Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
            here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            <br> <br>

            Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.

            <br> <br>
            Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation
            in his lifetime.

            <br><br>

            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”

            <br><br>

            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
            Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
            meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
            Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

            <br><br>

            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
            words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

            <br> <br>

            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
            known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin
            Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne
            to tell him the news.

            <br><br>

            <b> VIDEO HERE </b>

            <br> <br>

            Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.

            <br> <br>

            “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
            ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an
            email.

            <br> <br>

            Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news
            like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

            <br> <br>

            By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
            astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
