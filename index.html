            <p>
                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and
                a year’s appointment at Stanford,
                stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            <p>

            <p>
                He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created in
                the Big Bang.
                Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the
                presumed course of
                cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force,
                causing the universe
                to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>


            <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes
                like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous
                ballooning would iron out
                all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>

            <p>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>


            <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the
                Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
                known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

            <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
                Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac
                of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
                so-called
                gravitational waves — the signature of a universe
                being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                second
                old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence
                of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>

                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                whether it could ever be proved.
            </p>

            <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
                of
                dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
                space and energy to science and speculation.
            </p>

            <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
                its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                of
                other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

            <b> ‘As Big as It Gets’ </b>


            <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
                would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
                general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>


            <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
                said,
                “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>

            <P>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                gravitational
                waves.”</P>

            <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates
                space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
                the
                sun.
            </p>


            <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic
                Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics
                here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

            <p>
                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
            </p>


            <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
                confirmation
                in his lifetime.</p>

            <p>
                “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
            </p>

            <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
                Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
                meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
                Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>

            <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose
                his
                words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>


            <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
                known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
                Chao-Lin
                Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of
                Champagne
                to tell him the news.</p>

            </iframe>

            <p>
                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
            </p>

            <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that
                we
                ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an
                email.</p>

            <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having
                news
                like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>

            <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
                astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>

            <p>
                Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go
                down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
            </p>

            <p>
                John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
                called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful
                and very convincing,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
                universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
                expressed reservations about inflation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that
                the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
                European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
            </p>

            <p>
                “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
            </p>

            <p>
                Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year.
                At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.
            </p>

            <b> Spirals in the Sky </b>

            <p>
                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
                discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
                Prize.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of
                Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where
                the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
                Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
            </p>

            <p>
                “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has
                been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
            </p>

                    The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns —
                    the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth. <br> <span

            <p>
                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
                light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
                waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
                direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in
                the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
            </p>

            <p>
                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
                microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
            </p>

            <p>
                “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
            </p>

            <p>
                The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
                supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
                breakthrough.
